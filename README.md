#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is all about designing, building, testing, and maintaining software in a structured way. It’s a crucial part of computer science that ensures software functions correctly, efficiently, and securely.
Why It Matters in Tech
Ensures Reliability – Software needs to work correctly, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare and finance.
Boosts Efficiency – Streamlines development processes so that software is built faster without compromising quality.
Supports Growth – Helps systems scale up smoothly as demand increases, making them adaptable.
Enhances Security – Implements safeguards like encryption and authentication to protect user data.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering Complexity- As software systems grew larger, developers needed better ways to manage complexity. This led to structured programming and object-oriented programming, making code more organized and easier to maintain.
Mastering Process - The introduction of software development methodologies like the Waterfall model and Agile frameworks helped teams work systematically, improving project planning and efficiency.
Mastering Machine - There have been advancements that have led to high-level programming languages like C, Java, and Python, making software development more accessible 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Determines project goals, feasibility, and resource allocation.
Requirement Analysis – Gathers and defines user needs and software specifications.
Design – Creates system architecture, UI/UX layouts, and database structures.
Coding – Translates designs into functional software using programming languages.
Testing – Identifies and fixes bugs to ensure the software meets quality standards.
Deployment – Releases the software for real-world use.
Maintenance – Updates, improves, and fixes issues after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase of development must be completed before moving on to the next. It has low flexibility, meaning changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed. Customer feedback is usually gathered only at the end of the project, after full development. Testing occurs after the coding phase is complete, rather than throughout the process. This approach is best suited for projects where requirements are clearly defined from the beginning, such as developing banking software or safety-critical systems.

On the other hand, the Agile methodology is iterative and highly flexible, allowing for continuous adaptation to changing requirements. Customer feedback is incorporated throughout the development process, ensuring that the final product better meets user needs. Testing is done in every iteration, or sprint, allowing for early detection and resolution of issues. Agile is ideal for projects that require frequent updates and changes, such as mobile apps or web applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code, collaborates with team members, and ensures software functionality.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software, identifies bugs, ensures compliance with requirements, and develops automation scripts.
Project Manager – Leads the team, manages timelines and budgets, communicates with clients, and ensures successful project delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA) – Provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code efficiently.
Version Control Systems (VCS) (e.g., Git, SVN) – Track code changes, allow collaboration among developers, and enable rollback to previous versions if needed.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping Up with Technology – Continuous learning and adapting to new tools.
Tight Deadlines – Using Agile methods to break tasks into manageable sprints.
Changing Requirements – Implementing modular design for flexibility.
Security Risks – Using best security practices like encryption and authentication.
Complex Software Usability – Prioritizing user-friendly interfaces and testing usability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components to ensure they work correctly.
Integration Testing – Checks that different modules work together.
System Testing – Evaluates the entire software system’s performance and functionality.
Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user requirements before deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting specific inputs to guide AI in generating desired outputs.

Why it matters:
Improves accuracy and relevance of AI responses.
Reduces bias and enhances clarity.
Gives developers control over AI behavior.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Draw a person."
Improved Prompt: "Create a full-body digital illustration of a young man with short black hair, wearing a blue hoodie and sneakers, standing on a beach at sunset."

Why the improved prompt is better:
Clarity – Specifies the type of image (digital illustration, full-body).
Details – Describes appearance, clothing, and setting.
Conciseness – Provides enough information without being overly complex.
